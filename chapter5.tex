\section{Future directions}

We wish to symbolically define what programatically constitutes the sub-symbolic principles for the emergence of the neural mechanisms studied in this thesis. Furthermore, we wish to combine these mechanisms, investigating possible implications in the dual-network memory architecture. This could suggest further directions for the field of ANNs.

\section{Speculations about high-level cognition}
Continuous neural activity, perhaps even entirely deterministic, in the mammalian brain may actually be constituted entirely by the sum of accumulated experience. However, there may be some crucial parts responsible for mediating a type of focus in directing activity towards certain associations. Whether such an explicit mechanism exists, and whether it too may be entirely deterministic, remains a philosophical question. It should be noted that it lies in our command to recall memories, and even to imagine.
