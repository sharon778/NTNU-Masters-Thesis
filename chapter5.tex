One particular aspect leading to the advances is the inclusion of temporal information for larger time spans in deep neural networks, which is attained by using LSTM units or GRUs. However, these units are usually very spatially constrained topologically speaking, raising the question of whether such solutions are prone to segmentation issues where certain features may only be processed in a local neighbourhood.
