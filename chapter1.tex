\chapter{Introduction - [Macro level]}\label{chpt:intro}


AI has seen a tremendous increase of interest in the field in recent years. Why is that? What has changed? Well, its applications has dramatically increased. This is due to both algorithmic as well as computational advances. SLR of the field in the following(?) chapter.

These algorithms, and the field of AI, is largely connectionism. DEFINE: NNs solely based on matrices of weights and values, representing neurons' activation values and synaptic wirings and wiring strengths. This works well for some problems, and has been shown to be able to extract the principal components of a data-set, i.e. doing principal components analysis, by solely performing gradient-descent in weight space, minimizing the loss function of an error criterion (such as the norm of the difference between a target vector output and an acquired vector output).

Recent advances: Deep reinforcement learning. Deep neural networks. Hardware advances (GPUs). Algorithmic improvements using LSTMs or GRUs.

Convolutional nets: Learning feature extraction. More dynamic pre-processing layer.

Connectionism: Purely computer scientific?

Comp. Neuro.: Try and simulate aspects of brain functionality.

Examples of comp. neuro., example from connectionism? (FFBP).

Place model in context.

Nevne connectionism og comp. neuro.
one detailed example from comp. neuro. [CONTEXT]
Dual-network memory architecture, sub-field.

Coupling between the above. Justification for computer-scientific value? 
Could be that dual-network models may function in an intertwined that enables emergent phenomena which is previously unattained by single-network approaches. In addition to hypotheses within neuro., etc.

Establish clear topical question(s).
Short thesis outline.

Primary research question: “To study how the brain might implement working and long-term memory using the dual-network memory architecture, and to implement a novel dual-network memory model”
