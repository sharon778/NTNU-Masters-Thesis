(Deep learning/connectionism, why itâ€™s interesting and recent advances)
point out weaknesses
nevne convolutional nets
Nevne connectionism og comp. neuro.
one detailed example from comp. neuro. [CONTEXT]
Dual-network memory architecture, sub-field.
Coupling between the above. Justification for computer-scientific value? 
Could be that dual-network models may function in an intertwined that enables emergent phenomena which is previously unattained by single-network approaches. In addition to hypotheses within neuro., etc.
Establish clear topical question(s).
Short thesis outline.
