abstract = {The prefrontal cortex (PFC) subserves cognitive control: the ability to coordinate thoughts or actions in relation with internal goals. Its functional architecture, however, remains poorly understood. Using brain imaging in humans, we showed that the lateral PFC is organized as a cascade of executive processes from premotor to anterior PFC regions that control behavior according to stimuli, the present perceptual context, and the temporal episode in which stimuli occur, respectively. The results support an unified modular model of cognitive control that describes the overall functional organization of the human lateral PFC and has basic methodological and theoretical implications.},

@article{Miyake2000,
abstract = {This individual differences study examined the separability of three often postulated executive functions-mental set shifting ("Shifting"), information updating and monitoring ("Updating"), and inhibition of prepotent responses ("Inhibition")-and their roles in complex "frontal lobe" or "executive" tasks. One hundred thirty-seven college students performed a set of relatively simple experimental tasks that are considered to predominantly tap each target executive function as well as a set of frequently used executive tasks: the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Tower of Hanoi (TOH), random number generation (RNG), operation span, and dual tasking. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the three target executive functions are moderately correlated with one another, but are clearly separable. Moreover, structural equation modeling suggested that the three functions contribute differentially to performance on complex executive tasks. Specifically, WCST performance was related most strongly to Shifting, TOH to Inhibition, RNG to Inhibition and Updating, and operation span to Updating. Dual task performance was not related to any of the three target functions. These results suggest that it is important to recognize both the unity and diversity of executive functions and that latent variable analysis is a useful approach to studying the organization and roles of executive functions.},

@article{Srivastava2014,
abstract = {Connectionist models of memory storage have been studied for many years, and aim to provide insight into potential mechanisms of memory storage by the brain. A problem faced by these systems is that as the number of items to be stored increases across a finite set of neurons/synapses, the cumulative changes in synaptic weight eventually lead to a sudden and dramatic loss of the stored information (catastrophic interference, CI) as the previous changes in synaptic weight are effectively lost. This effect does not occur in the brain, where information loss is gradual. Various attempts have been made to overcome the effects of CI, but these generally use schemes that impose restrictions on the system or its inputs rather than allowing the system to intrinsically cope with increasing storage demands. We show here that catastrophic interference occurs as a result of interference among patterns that lead to catastrophic effects when the number of patterns stored exceeds a critical limit. However, when Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is combined with the Hebb-Hopfield model, the model attains the ability to eliminate CI. This approach differs from previous orthogonalisation schemes used in connectionist networks which essentially reflect sparse coding of the input. Here CI is avoided in a network of a fixed size without setting limits on the rate or number of patterns encoded, and without separating encoding and retrieval, thus offering the advantage of allowing associations between incoming and stored patterns.

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

@article{Yamashita2008a,
abstract = {It is generally thought that skilled behavior in human beings results from a functional hierarchy of the motor control system, within which reusable motor primitives are flexibly integrated into various sensori-motor sequence patterns. The underlying neural mechanisms governing the way in which continuous sensori-motor flows are segmented into primitives and the way in which series of primitives are integrated into various behavior sequences have, however, not yet been clarified. In earlier studies, this functional hierarchy has been realized through the use of explicit hierarchical structure, with local modules representing motor primitives in the lower level and a higher module representing sequences of primitives switched via additional mechanisms such as gate-selecting. When sequences contain similarities and overlap, however, a conflict arises in such earlier models between generalization and segmentation, induced by this separated modular structure. To address this issue, we propose a different type of neural network model. The current model neither makes use of separate local modules to represent primitives nor introduces explicit hierarchical structure. Rather than forcing architectural hierarchy onto the system, functional hierarchy emerges through a form of self-organization that is based on two distinct types of neurons, each with different time properties ("multiple timescales"). Through the introduction of multiple timescales, continuous sequences of behavior are segmented into reusable primitives, and the primitives, in turn, are flexibly integrated into novel sequences. In experiments, the proposed network model, coordinating the physical body of a humanoid robot through high-dimensional sensori-motor control, also successfully situated itself within a physical environment. Our results suggest that it is not only the spatial connections between neurons but also the timescales of neural activity that act as important mechanisms leading to functional hierarchy in neural systems.},

The corresponding singular values specify how much local variation is plausible in directions associated with the corresponding singular vectors, while remaining in a high-density region of the input space. This paper proposes a procedure for generating samples that are consistent with the local structure captured by a contractive auto-encoder. The associated stochastic process defines a distribution from which one can sample, and which experimentally appears to converge quickly and mix well between modes, compared to Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks. The intuitions behind this procedure can also be used to train the second layer of contraction that pools lower-level features and learns to be invariant to the local directions of variation discovered in the first layer. We show that this can help learn and represent invariances present in the data and improve classification error.},

abstract = {The currency of brains is primarily meaning and only secondarily information. Brain select and pre-process the information carried by sensory stimuli before they construct meaning, and they post-process cognitive meaning into informative commands that control appropriate action and express meaning. A grasp of the intervening process of perception by which meaning is created from information requires observation of neural activity in brains during meaningful behavior of humans and other animals. Measurement is followed by detailed analysis and modeling of the neural activity in order to deduce brain dynamics from brain operations. Unlike computer operation, brain function is hierarchical with many levels. Neurobiologists infer sensory and motor information by recording pulses of microscopic axons of neurons. They infer meaning by recording the local mean fields that are generated by the dendrites of neurons forming interactive mesoscopic and macroscopic populations. Neural populations express meaning in spatial pattern of amplitude modulation of electroencephalographic (EEG) waveforms in the higher frequency ranges of cortical oscillations. Improved theory is needed to understand how brains create meaning. The aim of the theory is to apply population neurodynamics to device new ways to treat clinical brain disorders, and to devise new machines with capacities for autonomy and intelligence that might approach those of simpler free-living animals.},

abstract = {My aim in this essay is to raise the question "Is there such a thing as mental illness?" and to argue that there is not. Since the notion of mental illness is extremely widely used nowadays, inquiry into the ways in which this term is employed would seem to be especially indicated. Mental illness, of course, is not literally a "thing" -- or physical object -- and hence it can "exist" only in the same sort of way in which other theoretical concepts exist. Yet, familiar theories are in the habit of posing, sooner or later -- at least to those who come to believe in them -- as "objective truths" (or "facts"). During certain historical periods, explanatory conceptions such as deities, witches, and microorganisms appeared not only as theories but as self-evident causes of a vast number of events. I submit that today mental illness is widely regarded in a somewhat similar fashion, that is, as the cause of innumerable diverse happenings. As an antidote to the complacent use of the notion of mental illness -- whether as a self-evident phenomenon, theory, or cause-- let us ask this question: What is meant when it is asserted that someone is mentally ill? In what follows I shall describe briefly the main uses to which the concept of mental illness has been put. I shall argue that this notion has outlived whatever usefulness it might have had and that it now functions merely as a convenient myth.},

abstract = {Gradient descent learning procedures are most often used in neural network modeling. When these algorithms (e.g., backpropagation) are applied to sequential learning tasks a major drawback, termed catastrophic forgetting (or catastrophic interference), generally arises: when a network having already learned a first set of items is next trained on a second set of items, the newly learned information may completely destroy the information previously learned. To avoid this implausible failure, we propose a two-network architecture in which new items are learned by a first network concurrently with internal pseudo-items originating from a second network. As it is demonstrated that these pseudo-items reflect the structure of items previously learned by the first network, the model thus implements a refreshing mechanism using the old information. The crucial point is that this refreshing mechanism is based on reverberating neural networks which need only random stimulations to operate. The model thus provides a means to dramatically reduce retroactive interference while conserving the essentially distributed nature of information and proposes an original but plausible means to copy and paste a distributed memory from one place in the brain to another.},

abstract = {Multilayer connectionist models of memory based on the encoder model using the backpropagation learning rule are evaluated. The models are applied to standard recognition memory procedures in which items are studied sequentially and then tested for retention. Sequential learning in these models leads to 2 major problems. First, well-learned information is forgotten rapidly as new information is learned. Second, discrimination between studied items and new items either decreases or is nonmonotonic as a function of learning. To address these problems, manipulations of the network within the multilayer model and several variants of the multilayer model were examined, including a model with prelearned memory and a context model, but none solved the problems. The problems discussed provide limitations on connectionist models applied to human memory and in tasks where information to be learned is not all available during learning.},

abstract = {Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce},

abstract = {Catastrophic forgetting is a problem faced by many machine learning models and algorithms. When trained on one task, then trained on a second task, many machine learning models "forget" how to perform the first task. This is widely believed to be a serious problem for neural networks. Here, we investigate the extent to which the catastrophic forgetting problem occurs for modern neural networks, comparing both established and recent gradient-based training algorithms and activation functions. We also examine the effect of the relationship between the first task and the second task on catastrophic forgetting. We find that it is always best to train using the dropout algorithm--the dropout algorithm is consistently best at adapting to the new task, remembering the old task, and has the best tradeoff curve between these two extremes. We find that different tasks and relationships between tasks result in very different rankings of activation function performance. This suggests the choice of activation function should always be cross-validated.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model called RNN Encoder--Decoder that consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNN). One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixed-length vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder--Decoder as an additional feature in the existing linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases.},
annote = {This is the paper that Axel Tidemann referred to in his talk at Yahoo labs on Thursday the 15th of Octobre. An RNN with a bottleneck in between two larger networks is used for learning to compress input through a vector, where the first “network” then will compress information (encode it) and the second will decompress it from the vector (decode it). The model is verified on language translation.
The fact that the Encoder-Decoder scheme is good at capturing linguistic regularities may suggest that an Encoder-Decoder like scheme is biologically plausible, and transferable to capturing regularities in any kind of compressed patterns. Linking this scheme to the proposed dual-network memory model of McClelland et al. (1995), this could explain partly why their model would work better to capture regularities in interleaving patterns/memories. Furthermore, it strengthens the suggestion that it is biologically plausible (?). It is also worth noting that encoding and decoding may eliminate catastrophic forgetting because of a certain created sparsity (?) and focus on the most important features. A question that remains is whether this compression leaves out crucial information. One way of fixing this, possibly biologically plausible, is to have the compression network self-organise to a certain extent, thus enabling it to select a compression vector of varying length with varying complexity. 
The model of the paper: Networks are jointly trained to maximise the conditional log-likelihood for the model parameters and input sequences to output sequences. A gradient-based approach can be used.
The hidden unit node is a simplified LSTM unit. May be considered an adaptive variant of a leaky-integrate and fire unit (Bengio et al., 2013).

The proposed model captures both semantic and syntactic structure in the languages. This suggests that the model does indeed capture some invariant features of patterns. Furthermore, what is captured in the model is interestingly somewhat orthogonal to previously existing language models.},

The method is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The method exhibits invariance to diagonal rescaling of the gradients by adapting to the geometry of the objective function. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. We demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.},

We offer a qualitative explanation of this failure and propose a novel and generic method of adding location-awareness to the attention mechanism to alleviate this issue. The new method yields a model that is robust to long inputs and achieves 18{\%} PER in single utterances and 20{\%} in 10-times longer (repeated) utterances.

Recent work suggests that some auto-encoder variants do a good job of capturing the local manifold structure of data. This paper clarifies some of these previous observations by showing that minimizing a particular form of regularized reconstruction error yields a reconstruction function that locally characterizes the shape of the data-generating density. We show that the auto-encoder captures the score (derivative of the log-density with respect to the input). It contradicts previous interpretations of reconstruction error as an energy function. Unlike previous results, the theorems provided here are completely generic and do not depend on the parameterization of the auto-encoder: they show what the auto-encoder would tend to if given enough capacity and examples. These results are for a contractive training criterion we show to be similar to the denoising auto-encoder training criterion with small corruption noise, but with contraction applied on the whole reconstruction function rather than just encoder. Similarly to score matching, one can consider the proposed training criterion as a convenient alternative to maximum likelihood because it does not involve a partition function. Finally, we show how an approximate Metropolis-Hastings MCMC can be setup to recover samples from the estimated distribution, and this is confirmed in sampling experiments.},

Although recurrent networks are extremely powerful in what they can in principle represent in terms ofmodeling sequences, their training is plagued by two aspects of the same issue regarding the learning of long-term dependencies. Experiments reported here evaluate the use of clipping gradients, spanning longer time ranges with leaky integration, advanced momentum techniques, using more powerful output probability models, and encouraging sparser gra- dients to help symmetry breaking and credit assignment. The ex- periments are performed on text and music data and show off the combined effects of these techniques in generally improving both training and test error.},

abstract = {The contractive auto-encoder learns a representation of the input data that captures the local manifold structure around each data point, through the leading singular vectors of the Jacobian of the transformation from input to representation. The corresponding singular values specify how much local variation is plausible in directions associated with the corresponding singular vectors, while remaining in a high-density region of the input space. This paper proposes a procedure for generating samples that are consistent with the local structure captured by a contractive auto-encoder. The associated stochastic process defines a distribution from which one can sample, and which experimentally appears to converge quickly and mix well between modes, compared to Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks. The intuitions behind this procedure can also be used to train the second layer of contraction that pools lower-level features and learns to be invariant to the local directions of variation discovered in the first layer. We show that this can help learn and represent invariances present in the data and improve classification error.},

“A central objective of machine learning is to generalize from training examples to new configurations of the observed variables, and in the most general setup this means deciding how to redistribute the probability mass associated with each training example form the empirical dsitribution” - In constrast, my aim is to create something which is able to infer any relationships in actual patterns. Furthermore, without catastrophic forgetting (more human-like).
Mixture model may identify the model in some cases with non-linear structures, and thus have the variances in directions orthogonal to the manifold small and constant. Also possible w/ kernel trick
Curse of dimensionality to capture the manifold with local generalisation (isn’t this the case with humans as well? the reason for why it doesn’t happen is largely because we’re constantly training, and have such a huge knowledge base?)
The parameters of the model, theta, is learned by minimising the Jacobian of the contractive encoder equation. The Contractive AE, in comparison with the AE, also adds a regularisation term which penalises the sensitivity of the features to the input, measured as the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian

abstract = {Deep learning algorithms seek to exploit the unknown structure in the input distribution in order to discover good representations, often at multiple levels, with higher-level learned features defined in terms of lower-level features. The objective is to make these higher- level representations more abstract, with their individual features more invariant to most of the variations that are typically present in the training distribution, while collectively preserving as much as possible of the information in the input. Ideally, we would like these representations to disentangle the unknown factors of variation that underlie the training distribution. Such unsupervised learning of representations can be exploited usefully under the hypothesis that the input distribution P(x) is structurally related to some task of interest, say predicting P(y|x). This paper focusses on why unsupervised pre-training of representations can be useful, and how it can be exploited in the transfer learning scenario, where we care about predictions on examples that are not from the same distribution as the training distribution},

a non-linear encoder (often) obtains a better representation, which can also be greedily stacked (Bengio et al., 07).
“to efficiently search for a good learning rate, a greedy heuristic that we used is based on the following strategy. Start with a large learning rate and reduce it (by a factor 3) until training does not diverge. The largest learning rate which does not give divergent training (increasing training error) is usually a very good choice of learning rate.”
stopping criterion could be chosen according to the derivative (because only using a convergence on the denoising error could overfit to the training data)
deep learning suitable for transfer learning because it learns high-level abstract representations

abstract = {Recurrent neural networks are powerful sequence learners. They are able to incorporate context information in a flexible way, and are robust to lo- calised distortions of the input data. These properties make them well suited to sequence labelling, where input sequences are transcribed with streams of labels. Long short-term memory is an especially promising recurrent archi- tecture, able to bridge long time delays between relevant input and output events, and thereby access long range context. The aim of this thesis is to advance the state-of-the-art in supervised sequence labelling with recurrent networks in general, and long short-term memory in particular. Its two main contributions are (1) a new type of output layer that allows recurrent networks to be trained directly for sequence labelling tasks where the align- ment between the inputs and the labels is unknown, and (2) an extension of long short-term memory to multidimensional data, such as images and video sequences. Experimental results are presented on speech recognition, online and offline handwriting recognition, keyword spotting, image segmen- tation and image classification, demonstrating the advantages of advanced recurrent networks over other sequential algorithms, such as hidden Markov Models. ii},

abstract = {In neural networks, when new patterns are learned by a network, the new information radically interferes with previously stored patterns. This drawback is called catastrophic forgetting or catastrophic interference. In this paper, we propose a biologically inspired neural network model which overcomes this problem. The proposed model consists of two distinct networks: one is a Hopfield type of chaotic associative memory and the other is a multilayer neural network. We consider that these networks correspond to the hippocampus and the neocortex of the brain, respectively. Information given is firstly stored in the hippocampal network with fast learning algorithm. Then the stored information is recalled by chaotic behavior of each neuron in the hippocampal network. Finally, it is consolidated in the neocortical network by using pseudopatterns. Computer simulation results show that the proposed model has much better ability to avoid catastrophic forgetting in comparison with conventional models.},

He does not however use it to solve any complex tasks, as the model presented is rather heavy in terms of computational complexity. He further demonstrates that the HPC network is capable of acquiring information rapidly, and also to consolidate this into the neocortical network (when it is extracted successfully).

In this adaptation, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is believed to have an important role, applying executive control on other cognitive processes to achieve context switching and confidence monitoring; however, many questions remain open regarding the nature of neural processes supporting executive control. The current work explores possible mechanisms of this high-order cognitive function, transferring executing control in the domain of artificial cognitive systems. In particular, we study the self-organization of artificial neural networks accomplishing a robotic rule-switching task analogous to the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. The obtained results show that behavioral rules may be encoded in neuro-dynamic attractors, with their geometric arrangements in phase space affecting the shaping of confidence. Analysis of the emergent dynamical structures suggests possible explanations of the interactions of high-level and low-level processes in the real brain. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Our analysis of the acquired dynamical structures indicates that an equivalence of compositionality appears in the combinatorial mechanics self-organized in the neuronal nonlinear dynamics. The manner in which this mechanism of compositionality, based on dynamical systems, differs from that considered in conventional linguistics and other synthetic computational models, is discussed in this paper.},

The grounding problem is addressed, but here solved with a dynamical systems approach, minimising a parametric bias vector error which connects the systems.

I think the network topologies should be inherently different in order to achieve this. Furthermore, the PB-vector itself should be self-organised.

{\&}quot;In contrast to using symbolic representations, some connectionist schemes have investigated the acquisition of both syntax and semantics in a co-dependent manner. It has been shown that a recurrent neural network (RNN) can acquire grammatical structures (Elman, 1990; Pollack, 1991) and semantics (Miikkulainen, 1993) from examples of sentences or string sequences. An RNN also demonstrated the ability to emulate the symbolic structures of finite state machines, hidden in the interaction between a real robot and its environment, in a robot navigation task (Tani, 1996).

This work has revealed striking similarities between remembering the past and imagining or simulating the future, including the finding that a common brain network underlies both memory and imagination. Here, we discuss a number of key points that have emerged during recent years, focusing in particular on the importance of distinguishing between temporal and nontemporal factors in analyses of memory and imagination, the nature of differences between remembering the past and imagining the future, the identification of component processes that comprise the default network supporting memory-based simulations, and the finding that this network can couple flexibly with other networks to support complex goal-directed simulations. This growing area of research has broadened our conception of memory by highlighting the many ways in which memory supports adaptive functioning.},

Just because some areas are activated both when past and future events are imagined, this does not imply that the same mechanisms/pathways are used for the two aspects of cognition. It has been shown that irrespective of the task, these parts are active during several forms of mental activity. Furthermore, the brain is thought to have a {\&}quot;default network{\&}quot; ((Raichle et al., 2001; for reviews, see Buckner et al., 2008; Andrews-Hanna, 2012), which would then almost always be active.

Although theories suggest that the hippocampus (HPC) is dedicated to represent specific episodes while the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) generalizes, other accounts posit that HPC can also integrate related memories. Here we use high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans to examine how representations of memory elements change to either differentiate or generalize across related events. We show that while posterior HPC and anterior MPFC maintain distinct memories for individual events, anterior HPC and posterior MPFC integrate across memories. Integration is particularly likely for established memories versus those encoded simultaneously, highlighting the greater impact of prior knowledge on new encoding.

abstract = {Connectionist networks in which information is stored in weights on connections among simple processing units have attracted considerable interest in cognitive science. Much of the interest centers around two characteristics of these networks. First, the weights on connections between units need not be prewired by the model builder but rather may be established through training in which items to be learned are presented repeatedly to the network and the connection weights are adjusted in small increments according to a learning algorithm. Second, the networks may represent information in a distributed fashion. This chapter discusses the catastrophic interference in connectionist networks. Distributed representations established through the application of learning algorithms have several properties that are claimed to be desirable from the standpoint of modeling human cognition. These properties include content-addressable memory and so-called automatic generalization in which a network trained on a set of items responds correctly to other untrained items within the same domain. New learning may interfere catastrophically with old learning when networks are trained sequentially. The analysis of the causes of interference implies that at least some interference will occur whenever new learning may alter weights involved in representing old learning, and the simulation results demonstrate only that interference is catastrophic in some specific networks.},

Its principle is that new knowledge is learned along with an internally generated activity reflecting the network history. What mainly distinguishes this model from others using pseudorehearsal in feedforward multilayer networks is a reverberating process used for generating pseudoitems. This process, which tends to go up to network attractors from random activation, is more suitable for capturing optimally the deep structure of previously learned knowledge than a single feedforward pass of activity. The proposed mechanism for ‘transporting memory’ without loss of information between two different brain structures could be viewed as a neurobiologically plausible means for consolidation in long-term memory. Knowledge transfer is explored with regard to learning speed, ability to generalize and vulnerability to network damages. We show that transfer is more efficient when two related tasks are sequentially learned than when they are learned concurrently.

The Organization of Behavior played a significant part in stimulating the investigation of the neural foundations of behavior and continues to be inspiring because it provides a general framework for relating behavior to synaptic organization through the dynamics of neural networks. D.O. Hebb was also the first to examine the mechanisms by which environment and experience can influence brain structure and function, and his ideas formed the basis for work on enriched environments as stimulants for behavioral development.

abstract = {Adaptive resonance architectures are neural networks that self-organize stable pattern recognition codes in real-time in response to arbitrary sequences of input patterns. This article introduces ART 2, a class of adaptive resonance architectures which rapidly self-organize pattern recognition categories in response to arbitrary sequences of either analog or binary input patterns. In order to cope with arbitrary sequences of analog input patterns-ART 2 architectures embody solutions to a number of design principles, such as the stability-plasticity tradeoff, the search-direct access tradeoff, and the match-reset tradeoff. In these architectures, top-down learned expectation and matching mechanisms are critical in self-stabilizing the code learning process. A parallel search scheme updates itself adaptively as the learning process unfolds, and realizes a form of real-time hypothesis discovery, testing, learning, and recognition. After learning selfstabilizes, the search process is automatically disengaged. Thereafter input patterns directly access their recognition codes without any search. Thus recognition time for familiar inputs does not increase with the complexity of the learned code. A novel input pattern can directly access a category if it shares invariant properties with the set of familiar exemplars of that category. A parameter called the attentional vigilance parameter determines how fine the categories will be. If vigilance increases (decreases) due to environmental feedback, then the system automatically searches for and learns finer (coarser) recognition categories. Gain control parameters enable the architecture to suppress noise up to a prescribed level. The architecture's global design enables it to learn effectively despite the high degree of nonlinearity of such mechanisms.},

annote = {Summary [could be an assignment 2 draft]: 
The authors present a series of experiments that address the sensitivity-stability problem. They show that a pseudo-recurrent network model, mainly inspired by McNaughton et al. (1995) performs significantly better than traditional FFBP networks. The different experiments are constructed to illuminate different aspects of the pseudo-recurrent network model. Their key confirmed finding is that pseudo-recurrent networks using pseudopatterns perform significantly better in terms of less catastrophic forgetting, according to both the Ebbinghaus-like savings measure as well as the percentage of explicit recognition of previously learned patterns. From this they hypothesise that the brain may perform some pseudopattern-like compression as well as pseudo-recurrent storage of information. Furthermore, they also demonstrate that this new model in contrast to older models is prone to the exact opposite of catastrophic forgetting - namely catastrophic remembering.
[A critique of this article would include] It should be noted that as the paper shows that catastrophic remembering does occur in special case events where incredibly overlapping inputs are presented, this does not necessarily demonstrate a direct biological implausibility as implied by the authors. This is because the nature of the input is biologically implausible in its own right (in being that overlapping). A biological input would indeed be much more sparse and varied (a much more large scale input). However, from an information theoretic perspective, it is interesting to look at the implications of very dense and overlapping inputs. It does however appear as if the brain itself boggles up certain memories and inputs that is sometimes presented to it. Thus it would be reasonable to state that some point of overlap is in fact biologically plausible. Secondly, the networks simulated are of such a small scale that they will only be able to generalise to a certain extent. This seems like a fact that has been largely ignored by the authors. Therefore it would be interesting to look at the implications of both increasing complexity as well as scale of the network simulated.

A model based on McClelland, McNaughton, {\&}amp; O’Reilly (1995)!
Addressing the sensitivity-stability dilemma (D. O. Hebb, 1949), or the Stability-plasticity problem (Carenter {\&}amp; Grossberg, 1987). Catastrophic interference is a sensitivity-stability problem. Connectionist networks and lookup tables at opposite ends of the stability-sensitivity spectrum (the latter is completely stable for new information, but no generalisation). Standard FFBP are highly sensitive to new input. The paper proposes an architecture that relies on separating the previously learned representations from those that are currently being learned. A method for approx. the previously learned data will be extracted and mixed with new patterns.

“Unlike French (1992, 1994), however, in which specific learning algorithms were incorporated to produce the semi-distributed representations that alleviated catastrophic interference, in the case of the pseudo-recurrent network, these internal semi-distributed representations emerge naturally.”
Perhaps the ability to fill in the missing information is a crucial mechanism. Not only as in autoassociative memory, but also in filling in the missing gaps of a story, as well as more importantly: To perform a procedure similar to that of regression. Is interleaving and presenting pseudo-recurrent patterns a way of gradually filling in the outcome space?},

abstract = {In this thesis we develop a novel network model that extends the traditional artificial neural network (ANN) model to include oscillatory behaviour. This model is able to correctly classify combinations of previously learned input patterns by grouping features that belong to the same category. This grouping process is termed segmentation and we show how synchrony of oscillations is the necessary missing component of ANNs to be able to perform this segmentation. Using this model we go on to show that top-down modulatory feedback is necessary to enable separation of multiple objects in a scene and segmentation of their individual features. This type of feedback is distinctly different than recurrency and is what enables the rich dynamics between the nodes of our network. Additionally, we show how our model's dynamics avoid the combinatorial explosion in required training repetitions of traditional feed-forward classification networks. In these networks, relations between objects must explicitly be learned. In contrast, the dynamics of modulatory feedback allow us to defer calculation of these relations until run-time, thus creating a more robust system. We call our model Fuzzy Oscillations, and it achieves good results when compared to existing models. However, oscillatory neural network models successful in achieving segmentation are a relatively recent development. We thus feel that our model is a contribution to the field of oscillatory neural networks.},
annote = {“While it sounds like a large undertaking, most of the tools already existed in various Python libraries. We used wxPython as graphical user interface, which produced a rather fully featured IDE, such as code coloring, integrated python shell, and even code completion.
All experiments in this thesis was done using this IDE and thus written in Python. A few libraries however was written in C++ and imported into the Python environment using boost.python as a bridge. The Izhikevich neuron environment is an example of this, as it is particularly computationally intensive”

In his master's thesis, $\backslash$cite{\{}Solbakken2009{\}} demonstrates that oscillations between populations of spiking neurons in an ANN model can synchronise the activity of the network. Both the activity of the network as a whole, and the activity of its dynamically formed populations of neurons and sub-networks. This enables segmentation of multidimensional data, through modulatory feedback, also largely avoiding a superposition catastrophe. Namely where objects that are to be segmented share many of the same features, and the network therefore fails to segment them into different categories and as distinct objects. Object recognition with shared features can be performed when populations of neurons learn to recognise features, and those features then represent representations of more abstract objects, for instance a bike or a car (which both have wheels). 
Extra dimension from populations
Extra dimension from time
Information processing made possible by synchronisation?
Avoiding the superposition bears certain similarities to node sharpening
It does feel like we do {\&}quot;choose{\&}quot; what our belief about an object is, including what we believe the constituent parts are. We don't see all possible parallels of resemblance to an object. It converges, and settles into a steady state. Analogy/example: Image of two figures which is ambiguous - once you have seen one of the figures hidden in it, you're likely to continue seeing that very figure.
Could pseudo-patterns be a kind of wave packet? I.e. when steam condenses to water droplets in terms of sensory data converging to meaningful representation? Is this the answer to the grounding problem? As it does alleviate the problem of catastrophic forgetting. Recurrence in general... What kind of mechanisms does recurrence give rise to? Geometrical representations form degrees of features for higher levels (G{\"{a}}rdenfors, 2004. Conceptual spaces: ...). The question is: Is a dynamical topology necessary? The answer should be yes (imo). What limitations does that put on a network? Plasticity. (Coupled to an EA could be a solution)
Isn't it unlikely that cells fire with a set frequency? These dynamics are more likely to be a result of the nature of neurons. I.e. the way in which they fire will most likely cause oscillatory sub-cycles to form short term memory, and long term memory may be constituted by another mechanism such as the slow interleaving. Pseudo-patterns being a proposed mechanism for the water droplet. Synchronicity may only be in the eyes of the observer - in a sense it is present, but in effect it is only the spontaneous response to whatever activity currently present. Might it be, that some processing is made possible due to the existence of physical delays in the networks? I.e. the propagation delay performs a significant processing role?
One thing seems to be apparent: Oscillations seem to play a key role in memory and segmentation in NNs and ANNs. It is here argued that oscillations will arise spontaneously in networks with recurrency without any type of centralised synchronization or clock.
The thesis may suggest that the reason for divergence in $\backslash$cite{\{}French2001{\}} is a version of the superposition catastrophe. Meaning that if pseudo-pattern generation is performed by retrieval from input with many features, this will tend to match a lot of cases. Reaching a steady state in retrieval might be the key to solve their problem of convergence.
Anyhow: The correct timing of the output from a network which segments a feature with another network which detects when this feature is present seems to be key in processes of abstraction.

In a sense solving the problem run-time rather than during training. More biologically plausible. The same with recurrency - to what extent?},

Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory pro-cessing systems 4,5 , the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopa-minergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms 3 .

abstract = {The mechanisms linking sensation and action during learning are poorly understood. Layer 2/3 neurons in the motor cortex might participate in sensorimotor integration and learning; they receive input from sensory cortex and excite deep layer neurons, which control movement. Here we imaged activity in the same set of layer 2/3 neurons in the motor cortex over weeks, while mice learned to detect objects with their whiskers and report detection with licking. Spatially intermingled neurons represented sensory (touch) and motor behaviours (whisker movements and licking). With learning, the population-level representation of task-related licking strengthened. In trained mice, population-level representations were redundant and stable, despite dynamism of single-neuron representations. The activity of a subpopulation of neurons was consistent with touch driving licking behaviour. Our results suggest that ensembles of motor cortex neurons couple sensory input to multiple, related motor programs during learning.},

abstract = {A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a powerful connectionist model that can be applied to many challenging sequential problems, including problems that naturally arise in language and speech. However, RNNs are extremely hard to train on problems that have long-term dependencies, where it is necessary to remember events for many timesteps before using them to make a prediction. In this paper we consider the problem of training RNNs to predict sequences that exhibit significant long-term dependencies, focusing on a serial recall task where the RNN needs to remember a sequence of characters for a large number of steps before reconstructing it. We introduce the Temporal-Kernel Recurrent Neural Network (TKRNN), which is a variant of the RNN that can cope with long-term dependencies much more easily than a standard RNN, and show that the TKRNN develops short-term memory that successfully solves the serial recall task by representing the input string with a stable state of its hidden units.},

Though a somewhat unusual (to me, at least) notation is used for the functions involved with the network, they introduce everything from scratch.
The main functionality of the TKRNN is to take into account what happened several timesteps in a leaky integrator fashion. This is done by weighting the contribution each timestep backwards in time exponentially less. We take into account the values of all connected nodes n time steps back in time. So if a node is connected to itself, the node's value is also taken into account (as part of the sum) n time steps backwards in time.},

The building block of a DBN is a probabilistic model called a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), used to represent one layer of the model. Restricted Boltzmann machines are interesting because inference is easy in them and because they have been successfully used as building blocks for training deeper models. We first prove that adding hidden units yields strictly improved modeling power, while a second theorem shows that RBMs are universal approximators of discrete distributions. We then study the question of whether DBNs with more layers are strictly more powerful in terms of representational power. This suggests a new and less greedy criterion for training RBMs within DBNs.},

Existing reduced models of the neuron either merge compartments, thereby sacrificing the spatial specificity of inputs, or apply model reduction techniques that sacrifice the underlying electrophysiology of the model. We use Krylov subspace projection methods to construct reduced models of passive and quasi-active neurons that preserve both the spatial specificity of inputs and the electrophysiological interpretation as an RC and RLC circuit, respectively. Each reduced model accurately computes the potential at the spike initiation zone (SIZ) given a much smaller dimension and simulation time, as we show numerically and theoretically. The structure is preserved through the similarity in the circuit representations, for which we provide circuit diagrams and mathematical expressions for the circuit elements. Furthermore, the transformation from the full to the reduced system is straightforward and depends on intrinsic properties of the dendrite. As each reduced model is accurate and has a clear electrophysiological interpretation, the reduced models can be used not only to simulate morphologically accurate neurons but also to examine computations performed in dendrites.},

abstract = {Five key topics have been reverberating in hippocampal-entorhinal cortex (EC) research over the past five decades: episodic and semantic memory, path integration ("dead reckoning") and landmark ("map") navigation, and theta oscillation. We suggest that the systematic relations between single cell discharge and the activity of neuronal ensembles reflected in local field theta oscillations provide a useful insight into the relationship among these terms. In rats trained to run in direction-guided (1-dimensional) tasks, hippocampal cell assemblies discharge sequentially, with different assemblies active on opposite runs, i.e., place cells are unidirectional. Such tasks do not require map representation and are formally identical with learning sequentially occurring items in an episode. Hebbian plasticity, acting within the temporal window of the theta cycle, converts the travel distances into synaptic strengths between the sequentially activated and unidirectionally connected assemblies. In contrast, place representations by hippocampal neurons in 2-dimensional environments are typically omnidirectional, characteristic of a map. Generation of a map requires exploration, essentially a dead reckoning behavior. We suggest that omnidirectional navigation through the same places (junctions) during exploration gives rise to omnidirectional place cells and, consequently, maps free of temporal context. Analogously, multiple crossings of common junction(s) of episodes convert the common junction(s) into context-free or semantic memory. Theta oscillation can hence be conceived as the navigation rhythm through both physical and mnemonic space, facilitating the formation of maps and episodic/semantic memories.},

annote = {On sparse distributed memory and semi-distributed representations in order to omit catastrophic forgetting. The SDM is an auto-associative, content-addressable memory using a very sparse way of distributing the memory. By having an incredibly large address space, information will rarely overlap and/or interfere. When it does, however (because the address space has been digested, etc.), neither new nor old information can be stored - thus a catastrophic forgetting will indeed occur. 
Another antidote for catastrophic forgetting is the ALCOVE algorithm, where the hidden nodes focuses more or less on local input nodes - making the network somewhat pre-specialised on certain inputs. From one PoV, it can be regarded as a regulariser. However, this network fails to generalise as well - for instance particularly when all of the hidden nodes should be specifically sensitive to say, one input node.
The main suggested solution: sharpening of activation of hidden units (log k, k is hidden nodes). It is observed to work fairly well. IMO: A lot has to do with the nature of the distribution that we’re working with. It’s also due to the nature of FFBP networks; it’s basically like PCA - a regulariser will work well to some extent when it’s chaotic - disregarding a lot of noise.},

abstract = {Damage to the hippocampal system disrupts recent memory but leaves remote memory intact. The account presented here suggests that memories are first stored via synaptic changes in the hippocampal system, that these changes support reinstatement of recent memories in the neocortex, that neocortical synapses change a little on each reinstatement, and that remote memory is based on accumulated neocortical changes. Models that learn via changes to connections help explain this organization. These models discover the structure in ensembles of items if learning of each item is gradual and interleaved with learning about other items. This suggests that the neocortex learns slowly to discover the structure in ensembles of experiences. The hippocampal system permits rapid learning of new items without disrupting this structure, and reinstatement of new memories interleaves them with others to integrate them into structured neocortical memory systems.},
annote = {Summary: The authors propose a memory model for the brain in which the hippocampus is responsible for the consolidation of memories into the neocortex, whereas it is the neocortex that stores the semantic, episodic, declarative, etc., memories. Whether the hippocampus functions as a working memory itself, or possibly operates on a short-term working memory present in the outer layers (2 and 3) of the neocortex, remains somewhat obscure (IMO the latter makes the most sense). In either way, the hippocampus is capable of fairly rapid information and knowledge acquisition based upon recent activation of the working memory. It is by the synthesis of recall from the deeper layers of the neocortex and representations in the working memory that contexts may be distinguished, or connected. The learning and consolidation to the neocortex is essentially performed in an interleaved fashion; slowly potentiating and instantiating these memories into the cortex.


“The answers we suggest to these questions arise from the study of learning in artificial neural network or connectionist models that adhere to many aspects of the account of the mammalian memory system provided earlier, but do not incorporate a special system for rapid acquisition of the contents of specific episodes and events. Such networks are similar to the neocortical processing system in that they may consist of several modules and pathways interconnecting the modules, but they are monolithic in the sense that knowledge is stored directly in the connections among the units of the system that carries out information processing, and there is no separate system for rapid learning of the contents of particular inputs.”
“(...) what one learns about something is stored in the connection weights among the units activated in representing it. That knowledge can be shared or generalized to other related things only if the patterns that represent these other things overlap (Hinton, McClelland, {\&}amp; Rumelhart, 1986).”
“ Dramatic confirmation of catastrophic effects of focused learning in real brains—and of the benefits of interleaved learning—can be found in the recent work of M. M. Merzenich (personal communication, January 18, 1995)”

‘Our claim is that experience can give rise to the gradual discovery of structure through interleaved learning but not through focused learning and that this gradual discovery process lies at the heart of cognitive, linguistic, and perceptual development.’ - Pp. 18
And that is precisely why, once we have developed natural language - we are able to gradually discover novel structure directly through the representations and structures that natural language provides us with.

{\&}quot;Reference versus working memory. The proposal of Olton, Becker, and Handelmann (1979) that the hippocampal system is necessary for what they called working memory (memory for recent information of specific current relevance) but not reference memory (memory for invariant aspects of a task situation) bears some similarity to our view that the cortex is specialized for the gradual discovery of the shared structure of events and experiences, whereas the hippocampus is necessary for the rapid storage of the contents of specific episodes and events. {\&}quot;},

abstract = {Theano is a compiler for mathematical expressions in Python that combines the convenience of NumPy’s syntax with the speed of optimized native machine language. The user composes mathematical expressions in a high-level description that mimics NumPy’s syntax and semantics, while being statically typed and functional (as opposed to imperative). These expressions allow Theano to provide symbolic differentiation. Before performing computation, Theano optimizes the choice of expressions, translates them into C++ (or CUDA for GPU), compiles them into dynamically loaded Python modules, all automatically. Common machine learning algorithms implemented with Theano are from 1.6× to 7.5× faster than competitive alternatives (including those implemented with C/C++, NumPy/SciPy and MATLAB) when compiled for the CPU and between 6.5× and 44× faster when compiled for the GPU. This paper illustrates how to use Theano, outlines the scope of the compiler, provides benchmarks on both CPU and GPU processors, and explains its overall design.},

A three-layer planning system combines mission, behavioral, and motion planning to drive in urban environments. The mission planning layer considers which street to take to achieve a mission goal. The behavioral layer determines when to change lanes and precedence at intersections and performs error recovery maneuvers. The motion planning layer selects actions to avoid obstacles while making progress toward local goals. The system was developed from the ground up to address the requirements of the DARPA Urban Challenge using a spiral system development process with a heavy emphasis on regular, regressive system testing. During the National Qualification Event and the 85-km Urban Challenge Final Event, Boss demonstrated some of its capabilities, qualifying first and winning the challenge.},

In this paper, we show that it can be well solved with deep learning and using both face identification and verification signals as supervision. The Deep IDentification-verification features (DeepID2) are learned with carefully designed deep convolutional networks. The face identification task increases the inter-personal variations by drawing DeepID2 extracted from different identities apart, while the face verification task reduces the intra-personal variations by pulling DeepID2 extracted from the same identity together, both of which are essential to face recognition. The learned DeepID2 features can be well generalized to new identities unseen in the training data. On the challenging LFW dataset, 99.15{\%} face verification accuracy is achieved. Compared with the best deep learning result on LFW, the error rate has been significantly reduced by 67{\%}.},

Here, we review recent research that brings this assumption into doubt. Instead, we propose that place cell spatial firing patterns are determined by environmental sensory inputs, including those representing the distance and direction to environmental boundaries, while grid cells provide a complementary self-motion related input that contributes to maintaining place cell firing. In this view, grid and place cell firing patterns are not successive stages of a processing hierarchy, but complementary and interacting representations that work in combination to support the reliable coding of large-scale space. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This article outlines a theoretical framework for the understanding of the neural basis of memory and consciousness, at systems level. It proposes an architecture constituted by: (1) neuron ensembles located in multiple and separate regions of primary and first-order sensory association cortices ("early cortices") and motor cortices; they contain representations of feature fragments inscribed as patterns of activity originally engaged by perceptuomotor interactions; (2) neuron ensembles located downstream from the former throughout single modality cortices (local convergence zones); they inscribe amodal records of the combinatorial arrangement of feature fragments that occurred synchronously during the experience of entities or events in sector (1); (3) neuron ensembles located downstream from the former throughout higher-order association cortices (non-local convergence zones), which inscribe amodal records of the synchronous combinatorial arrangements of local convergence zones during the experience of entities and events in sector (1); (4) feed-forward and feedback projections interlocking reciprocally the neuron ensembles in (1) with those in (2) according to a many-to-one (feed-forward) and one-to-many (feedback) principle. I propose that (a) recall of entities and events occurs when the neuron ensembles in (1) are activated in time-locked fashion; (b) the synchronous activations are directed from convergence zones in (2) and (3); and (c) the process of reactivation is triggered from firing in convergence zones and mediated by feedback projections. This proposal rejects a single anatomical site for the integration of memory and motor processes and a single store for the meaning of entities of events. Meaning is reached by time-locked multiregional retroactivation of widespread fragment records. Only the latter records can become contents of consciousness. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {A fundamental property of many associative memory networks is the ability to decorrelate overlapping input patterns before information is stored. In the hippocampus, this neuronal pattern separation is expressed as the tendency of ensembles of place cells to undergo extensive 'remapping' in response to changes in the sensory or motivational inputs to the hippocampus. Remapping is expressed under some conditions as a change of firing rates in the presence of a stable place code ('rate remapping'), and under other conditions as a complete reorganization of the hippocampal place code in which both place and rate of firing take statistically independent values ('global remapping'). Here we show that the nature of hippocampal remapping can be predicted by ensemble dynamics in place-selective grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex, one synapse upstream of the hippocampus. Whereas rate remapping is associated with stable grid fields, global remapping is always accompanied by a coordinate shift in the firing vertices of the grid cells. Grid fields of co-localized medial entorhinal cortex cells move and rotate in concert during this realignment. In contrast to the multiple environment-specific representations coded by place cells in the hippocampus, local ensembles of grid cells thus maintain a constant spatial phase structure, allowing position to be represented and updated by the same translation mechanism in all environments encountered by the animal.},

Its key unit is the 'grid cell', which is activated whenever the animal's position coincides with any vertex of a regular grid of equilateral triangles spanning the surface of the environment. Grids of neighbouring cells share a common orientation and spacing, but their vertex locations (their phases) differ. The spacing and size of individual fields increase from dorsal to ventral dMEC. The map is anchored to external landmarks, but persists in their absence, suggesting that grid cells may be part of a generalized, path-integration-based map of the spatial environment.},

These recurrent excitatory connections may play a dominant role in determining the information processing characteristics of this region. However, they result in feedback dynamics that may cause both runaway excitatory activity and runaway synaptic modification. Previous models of recurrent excitation have prevented unbounded activity using biologically unrealistic techniques. Here, the activation of feedback inhibition is shown to prevent unbounded activity, allowing stable activity states during recall and learning. In the model, cholinergic suppression of synaptic transmission at excitatory feedback synapses is shown to determine the extent to which activity depends upon new features of the afferent input versus components of previously stored representations. Experimental work in brain slice preparations of region CA3 demonstrates the cholinergic suppression of synaptic transmission in stratum radiatum, which contains synapses of the longitudinal association fibers.},

Hawkins develops a powerful theory of how the human brain works, explaining why computers are not intelligent and how, based on this new theory, we can finally build intelligent machines. The brain is not a computer, but a memory system that stores experiences in a way that reflects the true structure of the world, remembering sequences of events and their nested relationships and making predictions based on those memories. It is this memory-prediction system that forms the basis of intelligence, perception, creativity, and even consciousness. In an engaging style that will captivate audiences from the merely curious to the professional scientist, Hawkins shows how a clear understanding of how the brain works will make it possible for us to build intelligent machines, in silicon, that will exceed our human ability in surprising ways.},

However, the real world is three-dimensional, having a complex topography including both horizontal and vertical features, which presents additional challenges for representation and navigation. The present article reviews the emerging behavioral and neurobiological literature on spatial cognition in non-horizontal environments. We suggest that three-dimensional spaces are represented in a quasi-planar fashion, with space in the plane of locomotion being computed separately and represented differently from space in the orthogonal axis – a representational structure we have termed “bicoded.” We argue that the mammalian spatial representation in surface-travelling animals comprises a mosaic of these locally planar fragments, rather than a fully integrated volumetric map. More generally, this may be true even for species that can move freely in all three dimensions, such as birds and fish. We outline the evidence supporting this view, together with the adaptive advantages of such a scheme.</p>},

Here it is shown that activity patterns associated with multiple memories can be stored in a single neural network that exhibits nested oscillations similar to those recorded from the brain. Each memory is stored in a different high-frequency ("40 hertz") subcycle of a low-frequency oscillation. Memory patterns repeat on each low-frequency (5 to 12 hertz) oscillation, a repetition that relies on activity-dependent changes in membrane excitability rather than reverberatory circuits.

abstract = {This significant contribution to neuroscience consists of two papers, the first by Mountcastle an, the second by Edelman. Between them, they examine from different but complementary directions the relationships that connect the higher brain-memory, learning, perception, thinking-with what goes on at the most basic levels of neural activity, with particular stress on the role of local neuronal circuits.Edelman's major hypothesis is that "the conscious state results from phasic reentrant signaling occurring in parallel processes that involve associations between stored patterns and current sensory or internal input." This selective process occurs by the polling of degenerate primary repertoires of neuronal groups that are formed during embryogenesis and development. Edelman's theory extrapolates to the brain the selectionistic immunological theories for which he was awarded the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.Mountcastle's paper reviews what is known about the actual structure of various parts of the neo cortex. He relates the large entities of the neocortex to their component modules-the local neuronal circuits-and shows how the complex interrelationships of such a distributed system can yield dynamic distributed functioning.There are strong conceptual parallels between Mountcastle's idea of cortical columns and their functional subunits and Edelman's concept of populations of neurons functioning as processors in a brain system based on selectional rather than instructional principles. These parallels are traced and put into perspective in Francis Schmitt's Introduction.},

abstract = {The human hippocampus has been implicated in memory, in particular episodic or declarative memory. In rats, hippocampal lesions cause selective spatial deficits, and hippocampal complex spike cells (place cells) exhibit spatially localized firing, suggesting a role in spatial memory, although broader functions have also been suggested. Here we report the identification of the environmental features controlling the location and shape of the receptive fields (place fields) of the place cells. This was done by recording from the same cell in four rectangular boxes that differed solely in the length of one or both sides. Most of our results are explained by a model in which the place field is formed by the summation of gaussian tuning curves, each oriented perpendicular to a box wall and peaked at a fixed distance from it.},

abstract = {Single units were recorded from the CA1 field of the hippocampus in the freely-moving rat. They were classified as place units, displace units or others. Place units were defined as those for which the rat's position on the maze was a necessary condition for maximal unit firing. Some of these place units (misplace units) fired maximally when the animal sniffed in a place, either because it found something new there or failed to find something which was usually there. Displace units increased their rates during behaviors associated with theta activity in the hippocampal slow waves. In general these were behaviors which changed the rat's position relative to the environment. The influence of various environmental manipulations (e.g., turning off the room lights) on the firing pattern of the place units was tested and the results suggest that they were not responding to a simple sensory stimulus nor to a specific motor behavior. Nor could the unit firing be due purely to motivational or incentive factors. The results are interpreted as strong support for the cognitive map theory of hippocampal function. ?? 1976.},

@article{Rumelhart1985,
abstract = {This paper reports the results of our studies with an unsupervised learning paradigm which we have called "Competitive Learning." We have examined competitive learning using both computer simulation and formal analysis and have found that when it is applied to parallel networks of neuron-like elements, many potentially useful learning tasks can be accomplished. We were attracted to competitive learning because it seems to provide a way to discover the salient, general features which can be used to classify a set of patterns. We show how a very simply competitive mechanism can discover a set of feature detectors which capture important aspects of the set of stimulus input patterns. We also show how these feature detectors can form the basis of a multilayer system that can serve to learn categorizations of stimulus sets which are not linearly separable. We show how the use of correlated stimuli con serve as a kind of "teaching" input to the system to allow the development of feature detectors which would not develop otherwise. Although we find the competitive learning mechanism a very interesting and powerful learning principle, we do not, of course, imagine thot it is the only learning principle. Competitive learning is an essentially nonassociative statistical learning scheme. We certainly imagine that other kinds of learning mechanisms will be involved in the building of associations among patterns of activation in a more complete neural network. We offer this analysis of these competitive learning mechanisms to further our understanding of how simple adaptive networks can discover features important in the description of the stimulus environment in which the system finds itself. ?? 1985.},

To determine how information about location, direction, and distance is integrated in the grid-cell network, we recorded from each principal cell layer of MEC in rats that explored two-dimensional environments. Whereas layer II was predominated by grid cells, grid cells colocalized with head-direction cells and conjunctive grid x head-direction cells in the deeper layers. All cell types were modulated by running speed. The conjunction of positional, directional, and translational information in a single MEC cell type may enable grid coordinates to be updated during self-motion-based navigation.},

abstract = {Hippocampal pyramidal cells show location-specific firing as animals navigate through an en- vironment. It has been suggested that this firing could result from the "local view" available in a cell's field. Hippocampal damage results in learning deficits on a wide variety oftasks. This, along with the fact that an associative form ofplasticity has been discovered in the hippocampus has led to the idea that this strueture might serve as a distributed, associative-matrix memory device. Here, these ideas are combined in a model in which pyramidal cells are the output layer of a competitive-learning, pattern-classification device. The inputs are patterns of environmen- tal stimuli as viewed by a computerized "rat" from various locations within a simulated environ- ment. These patterns are "classified" on the basis oftheir similarity. Since views available from contiguous regions of space are similar, single cells come to fire in a circumscribed region (place field). Firing-rate maps for these theoretical units show place fields remarkably similar to those of actual place cells. Also, they show remarkably similar behavior to that of real cells when tested under some of the probe conditions similar to those which have been used for actual cells.},

The neural network, which has 60 million paramters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolutional operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers, we employed a recently-developed method called 'dropout' that proved to be effective. We also entered a variant of the model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achievd a top-5 test error rate of 15.3{\%}, compared to 26.2{\%} achieved by the second-best entry.},

abstract = {It is proposed that the most important characteristic of archicortex is its ability to perform a simple kind of memorizing task. It is shown that rather general numerical constraints roughly determine the dimensions of memorizing models for the mammalian brain, and from these is derived a general model for archicortex. The addition of further constraints leads to the notion of a simple representation, which is a way of translating a great deal of information into the firing of about 200 out of a population of 10{\$}{\^{}}5{\$} cells. It is shown that if about 10{\$}{\^{}}5{\$} simple representations are stored in such a population of cells, very little information about a single learnt event is necessary to provoke its recall. A detailed numerical examination is made of a particular example of this kind of memory, and various general conclusions are drawn from the analysis. The insight gained from these models is used to derive theories for various archicortical areas. A functional interpretation is given of the cells and synapses of the area entorhinalis, the prcsubiculum, the prosubiculum, the cornu ammonis and the fascia dentata. Many predictions are made, a substantial number of which must be true if the theory is correct. A general functional classification of typical archicortical cells is proposed.},

Although it is believed that the hippocampus is essential to store some kinds of memory, the role of neuronal turnover in the hippocampus have not been understood yet. In this paper, we examine the effect of neuronal turnover by using a hippocampal model. Computer simulation results show that the similarity of patterns to be stored is reduced by neuronal turnover, and this contributes to storing similar patterns easily and increasing the storage capacity. Moreover, we show that the number of learning epochs required to store all patterns can be reduced as the neuronal turnover rate becomes large.},
