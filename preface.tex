Deep Learning has become an extremely successful (and hence popular) classification method in AI and Machine Learning over the past couple of years.  Many of the big(gest) computer companies have bought up top-level neural network gurus to help them take advantage of this technology.
In this project, the student can suggest a domain to which they would like to apply deep networks, and then they will use the Theano system to solve a problem in that domain.

Topic: Generalisation, Catastrophic Forgetting and High-level
Cognition: A Novel Unified Deep Learning Approach
\\\\
Questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item How can deep learning advance towards stronger AI?
\item How can deep learning algorithms generalise better?
\item And how can the problem of catastrophic forgetting be handled in DL?
\item How may high-level cognition be constituted in DL algorithms?
\item Can a unified model achieving both the latter be attained?
\ldots
\end{itemize}
