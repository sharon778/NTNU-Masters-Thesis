\section{Preliminary results}

\textbf{100 \% connection ratio EC-CA3:}

Fairly rapid convergence for three patterns in HPC-module for turnover between every training set iteration. 
Not necessarily successful recall of all patterns. Does this have something to do with the synchronized CA3-layer during recall? Separation possible during recall when the desired pattern(s) are presented to the network - however, not all may be recalled.

-> New random pattern each time stability was reached resulted in better recall.

Is this also the case for heavier weighting of the DG-CA3 path during learning?

Spurious pattern reduction/correlation with occurrence when using turnover?

Convergence when turnover is removed between set iterations?

\section{Model calibration}

Experiments designed for model calibration

Dimensions analyzed outlined above.

First: STM-network extraction rate (at first, empirically observed to be same as solely auto-associative Hopfield network).
